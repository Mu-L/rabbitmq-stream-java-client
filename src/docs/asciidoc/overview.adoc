== What is a RabbitMQ Stream?

A RabbitMQ stream is a persistent and replicated data structure that models
an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Append-only[append-only log]. It differs from the classical
RabbitMQ queue in the way message consumption works. In a classical RabbitMQ queue,
consuming removes messages from the queue. In a RabbitMQ stream, consuming leaves
the stream intact. So the content of a stream can be read and re-read without
impact or destructive effect.

None of the stream or classical queue data structure is better than the other,
they are usually suited for different use cases.

== When to Use RabbitMQ Stream?

RabbitMQ Stream was developed to cover the following messaging use cases:

* _Large fan-outs:_ when several consumer applications need to read the same messages.
* _Replay / Time-traveling:_ when consumer applications need to read the whole
history of data or from a given point in a stream.
* _Throughput performance:_ when higher throughput than with other protocols
(AMQP, STOMP, MQTT) is required.
* _Large logs:_ when large amount of data need to be stored, with minimal
in-memory overhead.

== Other Way to Use Streams in RabbitMQ

It is also possible to use the stream abstraction in RabbitMQ
with the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol. Instead of consuming from a stream
with the stream protocol, one consumes from a "stream-powered" queue with
the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol. A "stream-powered" queue is a special type of queue that
is backed up with a stream infrastructure layer and adapted to
provide the stream semantics (mainly non-destructive reading).

Using such a queue has the advantage to provide the features
inherent to the stream abstraction (append-only structure, non-destructive
reading) with any AMQP 0-9-1 client library. This is clearly
interesting when considering the maturity of AMQP 0-9-1 client libraries
and the ecosystem around AMQP 0-9-1.

But by using it, one does not benefit from the performance
of the stream protocol, which has been designed for performance in mind,
whereas AMQP 0-9-1 is a more general-purpose protocol.

It is not possible to use "stream-powered" queues with the stream Java client,
you need to use an AMQP 0-9-1 client library.

== Guarantees

RabbitMQ stream provides at-least-once guarantees thanks to the
publisher confirm mechanism, which is supported by the stream Java client.

Message <<api.adoc#outbound-message-deduplication,deduplication>>
is also supported on the publisher side.

== Stream Client Overview

The RabbitMQ Stream Java Client implements the
https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/v{broker-version}.x/deps/rabbitmq_stream/docs/PROTOCOL.adoc[RabbitMQ Stream protocol]
and avoids dealing with low-level concerns by providing high-level functionalities
to build fast, efficient, and robust client applications.

* _administrate streams (creation/deletion) directly from applications._ This
can also be useful for development and testing.
* _adapt publishing throughput_ thanks to the configurable batch size and flow control.
* _avoid publishing duplicate messages_ thanks to message deduplication.
* _consume asynchronously from streams and resume where left off_ thanks to
automatic or manual offset tracking.
* _enforce https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2021/07/23/connecting-to-streams/#client-workaround-with-a-load-balancer[best practices] to create client connections_ â€“ to stream leaders for publishers to minimize inter-node traffic and to stream replicas for consumers to offload leaders.
* _optimize resources_ thanks to automatic growing and shrinking of
connections depending on the number of publishers and consumers.
* _let the client handle network failure_ thanks to automatic connection
recovery and automatic re-subscription for consumers.
* _publish metrics_ to monitoring systems like https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] and _ship spans_ to distributed tracing backends like https://zipkin.io/[OpenZipkin] or https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability[Wavefront] thanks to built-in support for https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer].

== Versioning

This library uses https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

The next section provides more details about the evolution of programming interfaces.

[[stability-of-programming-interfaces]]
== Stability of Programming Interfaces

The client contains 2 sets of programming interfaces whose stability are of interest for application developers:

* Application Programming Interfaces (API): those are the ones used to write application logic.
They include the interfaces and classes in the `com.rabbitmq.stream` package (e.g. `Producer`, `Consumer`, `Message`).
These API constitute the main programming model of the client and are kept as stable as possible.
New features may require to add methods to existing interfaces.
* Service Provider Interfaces (SPI): those are interfaces to implement mainly technical behavior in the client.
They are not meant to be used to implement application logic.
Application developers may have to refer to them in the configuration phase and if they want to customize some internal behavior of the client.
SPI include interfaces and classes in the `com.rabbitmq.stream.codec`, `com.rabbitmq.stream.compression`, `com.rabbitmq.stream.metrics` packages, among others.
_These SPI are susceptible to change, but this should have no impact on most applications_, as the changes are likely to be limited to the client internals.

== Pre-requisites

This library requires at least Java 11, but Java 21 or more is recommended.
